ActionController::UnknownFormat (PostsController#edit is missing a template for this request format and variant.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not… nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

Carr was pressured on only 21.6 percent of his dropbacks, the fifth-lowest rate among starting quarterbacks. A quarterback who gets the ball out quickly can distort that number (see: Tom Brady), but other metrics suggest that wasn't the case with Carr. He took 2.44 seconds before his typical pass, 15th in the league. Carr's average throw traveled 7.67 yards in the air, which was slightly below league average and one full yard deeper than the typical Bridgewater pass (6.66)."], ["user_id", 3]]

ActionController::UnknownFormat (CommentsController#index is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not… nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

Here's how my transition into coaching has impacted my view of game prep, scheme, technique, player development and more.\r\n\r\nThe spread offense is legit: Yeah, I was one of those guys who used to look down on the college and high school spread systems. I didn't see it much during my time in the Big Ten at Iowa or throughout my seven-year career in the NFL. It was pro-style or nothing. And I wouldn't budge.\r\n\r\nBut my view has completely changed at IC Catholic due to our offense -- an up-tempo, no-huddle spread system. We play fast, now. Super-fast. It's a two-minute drill for four quarters.
